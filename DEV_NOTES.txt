	rename the object "animate" function to something more representative of what it actually does (moves the sprite), as "animate" will
	be something totally seperate in the future when i get around to implementing animation.

	I've been thinking the movement feels a little clunky. When the player moves, there are a few hundred ms where attempting
	to move does not work, as the AI is taking its turn and animating it's moves. This feels frustrating. To remedy this, I'll 
	put in something that notifies the player when they can move. Probably arrows surrounding the player on the ground. When the arrows appear, 
	the player can move. When they're gone, they wait. This should remove any frustration caused by buttons not responding.
	Also, ai should only animate when it's on screen. This should make movement quicker when theres nobody else on screen.

	Clean up the mapgen functions. Restore order to this horrible file
